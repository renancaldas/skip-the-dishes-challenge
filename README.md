#### 2. Description

This is a challenge proposed by [Skip the Dishes](https://www.skipthedishes.com/) for the [VanHackathon 2018](https://www.vanhack.com/hackathon/) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The objective is to create an aplication (in React) for ordering food.

To run it, follow these steps:
```
Clone the project, "cd" to the folder and run:

$ npm install
$ npm start
```

#### 3. Considerations
---
- This is an incomplete app. I had some problems with the wifi at the Hotel hosting the event.
